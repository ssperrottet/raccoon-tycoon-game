# Terminal Tycoon

Terminal Tycoon is a text-based strategy game inspired by the popular board game Raccoon Tycoon. In this game, players engage in a dynamic market, trading resources, constructing buildings, and trying to amass wealth. The game is designed to be played entirely in the terminal, offering a streamlined and nostalgic gaming experience.

This version of the project is currently paused in favor of a full-scale Godot implementation.
